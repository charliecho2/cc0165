        <h2>Review of Brothers Karamazov, How to start implementing reading in your daily life</h2>
        Ivan Karamazov. 
        <p>
            I've found Ivan Karamazov very interesting in the book. He's unlike many other characters of fiction you find. 
            But why is Ivan Karamazov, and the book Brothers Karamazov have anything to do with implementing daily life reading?
            And who am I to tell you to do this or that, let alone do what's so exhausting and boring, reading? And that, it's 
            famous for being the most difficult literature to read no? Gibberish and nothing but waste of time to read even this blog no? 
            I've started reading this book 'brothers karamazov' because of a man named OSHO. I was able to read of course, I wasn't dyslexic, 
            yet, putting reading into my daily habits was something I never tried. I was deeply enamored by the worlds of meditation and 
            Taoist ideas about how one should conduct one's life. I was only in highschool, and shakespeare in school, readings forced in school 
            implanted a hatred for reading 
            because I would like to fight you is this justified? </p>
